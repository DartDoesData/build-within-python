    "    * [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - the best place for learning pandas, this resource covers all of the pandas functionality.\n",

    "    * [Ask Kisha](https://chat.openai.com/) - Google Gemini, ChatGPT, and others are very good at explaining code, however, these tools can make mistakes, so it's important to understand the basics. Best to verify the code it writes first before using it. Try asking \"Can you explain the following code for me? {your code here}\" and then continue with follow up questions from there.\n",

    "The next steps here are to read through the post and see if it relates to your problem. If it does, great, take the code/information you need and **rewrite it** to suit your own problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ask for help** - If you've been through the above 2 steps and you're still stuck, you might want to ask your question on Stack Overflow. Remember to be specific as possible and provide details on what you've tried.\n",

    "* [`DataFrame.head(n=5)`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.head.html) - Displays the first `n` rows of a DataFrame (e.g. `car_sales.head()` will show the first 5 rows of the `car_sales` DataFrame).\n",
    "* [`DataFrame.tail(n=5)`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.tail.html) - Displays the last `n` rows of a DataFrame.\n",
    "* [`DataFrame.loc[]`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html) - Accesses a group of rows and columns by labels or a boolean array.\n",
    "* [`DataFrame.iloc[]`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.iloc.html) - Accesses a group of rows and columns by integer indices (e.g. `car_sales.iloc[0]` shows all the columns from index `0`.\n",
    "* [`DataFrame.columns`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.columns.html) -  Lists the column labels of the DataFrame.\n",
    "* `DataFrame['A']` - Selects the column named `'A'` from the DataFrame.\n",
    "* `DataFrame[DataFrame['A'] > 5]` - Boolean indexing filters rows based on column values meeting a condition (e.g. all rows from column `'A'` greater than `5`.\n",
    "* [`DataFrame.plot()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html) - Creates a line plot of a DataFrame's columns (e.g. plot `Make` vs. `Odometer (KM)` columns with `car_sales[[\"Make\", \"Odometer (KM)\"]].plot();`).\n",
    "* [`DataFrame.hist()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.hist.html) - Generates histograms for columns in a DataFrame.\n",
    "* [`pandas.crosstab()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.crosstab.html) - Computes a cross-tabulation of two or more factors.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main topics we covered\n",
    "* [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html) - a single column (can be multiple rows) of values.\n",
    "* [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html) - multiple columns/rows of values (a DataFrame is comprised of multiple Series).\n",
    "* [Importing data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/io.html) - we used [`pd.read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html#pandas-read-csv) to read in a CSV (comma-separated values) file but there are multiple options for reading data.\n",
    "* [Exporting data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/io.html) - we exported our data using `to_csv()`, however there are multiple methods of exporting data.\n",
    "* [Describing data](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html)\n",
    "    * `df.dtypes` - find the datatypes present in a dataframe.\n",
    "    * `df.describe()` - find various numerical features of a dataframe.\n",
    "    * `df.info()` - find the number of rows and whether or not any of them are empty.\n",
    "* [Viewing and selecting data](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#viewing-data)\n",
    "    * `df.head()` - view the first 5 rows of `df`.\n",
    "    * `df.loc` & `df.iloc` - select specific parts of a dataframe.\n",
    "    * `df['A']` - select column `A` of `df`.\n",
    "    * `df[df['A'] > 1000]` - selection column `A` rows with values over 1000 of `df`.\n",
    "    * `df['A']` - plot values from column `A` using matplotlib (defaults to line graph).\n",
    "* [Manipulating data and performing operations](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#operations) - pandas has many built-in functions you can use to manipulate data, also many of the Python operators (e.g. `+`, `-`, `>`, `==`) work with pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further reading\n",
    "Since pandas is such a large library, it would be impossible to cover it all in one go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some resources you might want to look into for more.\n",
    "* [Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) - possibly the most complete text of the pandas library (apart from the documentation itself) written by the creator of pandas.\n",
    "* [Data Manipulation with Pandas (section of Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas)](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.00-introduction-to-pandas.html) - a very hands-on approach to many of the main functions in the pandas library.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "After completing this notebook, you next thing should be to try out some more pandas code of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd suggest at least going through number 1 (write out all the code yourself), a couple from number 2 (again, write out the code yourself) and spend an hour reading number 3 (this is vast but keep it in mind).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [10-minute introduction to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) - go through all the functions here and be sure to write out the code yourself.\n",
    "2. [Pandas getting started tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html) - pick a couple from here which spark your interest and go through them both writing out the code for your self.\n",
    "3. [Pandas essential basic functionality](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/basics.html) - spend an hour reading this and bookmark it for whenever you need to come back for an overview of pandas."
