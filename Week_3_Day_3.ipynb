        "\n",
        "### Why Use Colab Secrets?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You should **never store sensitive information, API keys, passwords, database connection details, etc.** in your code. Never do this.\n",
        "2. Storing keys as Colab Secrets prevents accidental sharing and keeps them out of your code.\n",
        "3. Secrets are stored in your Colab environment, so you don‚Äôt need to re-enter them every session.\n",
        "4. Secrets can be accessed directly using the `os.getenv()` method, making it straightforward to use them in your code.\n",

        "1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n",
        "2. Search for **Places API** and click **Enable**.\n",
        "3. Search for **Geocoding API** and click **Enable**.\n",
        "4. From the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page, find your API key and click \"SHOW KEY.\"\n",
        "5. Copy your API key.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 2: Store Your API Key in Colab Secrets\n",
        "\n",
        "1. In your Colab notebook, look for the secrets (key) icon on the left panel.\n",
        "2. In the Secrets tab, click **+ Add a new secret**.\n",
        "3. Enter `GOOGLE_API_KEY` as the **Name**, and paste your API key as the **Value**.\n",
        "4. Be sure to set the **Notebook access** toggle to \"on\" (checked).\n",
        "5. Save the secret, and Colab will securely store it for future use.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 3: Access the API Key in Your Code\n",
        "\n",
        "Once stored, you can retrieve the key securely in your Colab notebook using `os.getenv`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "\n",
        "An **API** (Application Programming Interface) allows two applications (like your Python code and Google Maps) to talk to each other. Think of an API as a menu in a restaurant. It tells you what services (or data) are available and how to ask for them.\n",

        "In our example, we‚Äôre using Google Maps‚Äô API to ask Google for information about a place.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is a Request?\n",
        "\n",
        "When we talk to an API, we make a **request** to it. This is like asking a question or ordering from a menu.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**What is an endpoint?**\n",
        "- An **endpoint** is the web address we send our request to. Each API has its own endpoint based on what you want to do.\n",
        "\n",

        "1. `input`: The name of the place we‚Äôre looking for (e.g., ‚ÄúThe White House‚Äù).\n",
        "2. `inputtype`: Tells Google Maps that our `input` is text.\n",
        "3. `fields`: Which information about the place we want (like name, location, and address).\n",
        "4. `key`: Our API key, which is like our access pass to use Google Maps.\n",
        "\n",
        "More information on parameters is in Google Maps documentation. Here are some parameters for our code:\n",

        "\n",
        "- **2xx**: Success! These codes indicate that the request worked. `200` is the most common, meaning ‚ÄúOK,‚Äù but other 2xx codes, like `201` (Created), are also successful responses.\n",
        "- **3xx**: Redirection. These codes mean the request was received, but we may need to take additional steps to get the data. For example, `304` (Not Modified) is a common 3xx code.\n",
        "- **4xx**: Client Error. These codes indicate a problem with the request (e.g., `404` means the resource wasn‚Äôt found).\n",
        "- **5xx**: Server Error. These codes mean the API server encountered an error (e.g., `500` means a general server error).\n",
        "\n",
        "We can check the status code of our response like this:\n",
        "\n",

        "if response.status_code == 200:\n",
