        "\n",
        "### Why Use Colab Secrets?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You should **never store sensitive information, API keys, passwords, database connection details, etc.** in your code. Never do this.\n",
        "2. Storing keys as Colab Secrets prevents accidental sharing and keeps them out of your code.\n",
        "3. Secrets are stored in your Colab environment, so you don’t need to re-enter them every session.\n",
        "4. Secrets can be accessed directly using the `os.getenv()` method, making it straightforward to use them in your code.\n",

        "1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n",
        "2. Search for **Places API** and click **Enable**.\n",
        "3. Search for **Geocoding API** and click **Enable**.\n",
        "4. From the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page, find your API key and click \"SHOW KEY.\"\n",
        "5. Copy your API key.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 2: Store Your API Key in Colab Secrets\n",
        "\n",
        "1. In your Colab notebook, look for the secrets (key) icon on the left panel.\n",
        "2. In the Secrets tab, click **+ Add a new secret**.\n",
        "3. Enter `GOOGLE_API_KEY` as the **Name**, and paste your API key as the **Value**.\n",
        "4. Be sure to set the **Notebook access** toggle to \"on\" (checked).\n",
        "5. Save the secret, and Colab will securely store it for future use.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 3: Access the API Key in Your Code\n",
        "\n",
        "Once stored, you can retrieve the key securely in your Colab notebook using `os.getenv`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "\n",
        "An **API** (Application Programming Interface) allows two applications (like your Python code and Google Maps) to talk to each other. Think of an API as a menu in a restaurant. It tells you what services (or data) are available and how to ask for them.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our example, we’re using Google Maps’ API to ask Google for information about a place.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is a Request?\n",
        "\n",
        "When we talk to an API, we make a **request** to it. This is like asking a question or ordering from a menu.\n",
        "\n",
        "- We’re saying, “Google Maps, can you find this place for us?”\n",
        "- Google Maps will respond with information about that place.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make this request, we need three main things:\n",
        "1. **Endpoint** (the address of the API)\n",

        "## Making an API request\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Define the API Endpoint\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is an endpoint?**\n",
        "- An **endpoint** is the web address we send our request to. Each API has its own endpoint based on what you want to do.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For example, if we want to search for a place using text (like “The White House”), Google Maps provides a specific endpoint for that type of request:\n",

        "- The `/findplacefromtext/json` part tells Google Maps that we’re searching for a place based on text. This piece often comes from the **API documentation**.\n",
        "- The **JSON** part tells the API we want our response in JSON format (a way of structuring data that’s easy to read and use).\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s start by defining this endpoint in our code.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**What are parameters?**\n",
        "- **Parameters** are like extra details for our request. They help us customize what we’re asking for.\n",
        "- Imagine you’re ordering coffee; parameters are like specifying if you want milk, sugar, or decaf.\n",
        "\n",
        "For our place search, Google Maps expects these parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `input`: The name of the place we’re looking for (e.g., “The White House”).\n",
        "2. `inputtype`: Tells Google Maps that our `input` is text.\n",
        "3. `fields`: Which information about the place we want (like name, location, and address).\n",
        "4. `key`: Our API key, which is like our access pass to use Google Maps.\n",
        "\n",
        "More information on parameters is in Google Maps documentation. Here are some parameters for our code:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Define the parameters for our request\n",
        "params = {\n",

        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Make the Request\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have our **endpoint** and **parameters**, we can make the request to Google Maps. This request will go to the API, and we’ll get a response back with data.\n",

        "### Step 4: Check the Response\n",
        "\n",
        "After making the request, we should check if it was successful by looking at the **status code**. Status codes are numbers the API sends back to let us know how the request went. Here’s a quick guide to common status code categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **2xx**: Success! These codes indicate that the request worked. `200` is the most common, meaning “OK,” but other 2xx codes, like `201` (Created), are also successful responses.\n",
        "- **3xx**: Redirection. These codes mean the request was received, but we may need to take additional steps to get the data. For example, `304` (Not Modified) is a common 3xx code.\n",
        "- **4xx**: Client Error. These codes indicate a problem with the request (e.g., `404` means the resource wasn’t found).\n",
        "- **5xx**: Server Error. These codes mean the API server encountered an error (e.g., `500` means a general server error).\n",
        "\n",
        "We can check the status code of our response like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Check if the request was successful\n",
        "if response.status_code == 200:\n",

        "In this activity, you’ll practice using the Google Maps API to search for a location and organize the data into a dictionary. Follow the steps carefully, and refer back to the earlier examples as needed.\n",

        "### Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Choose a Location**:\n",
        "   - Use the `findplacefromtext` endpoint to search for “Washington Monument.” This is a text-based search where you specify the name of a place.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Request Location Data**:\n",
        "   - Send a request to the Google Maps API using the endpoint and parameters needed for this search. Make sure you’re using your API key and specifying the fields you want to receive (name, address, latitude, longitude).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Extract Information**:\n",
        "   - Once you get the response, extract the following information and store it in separate variables:\n",
        "     - **Name** of the location\n",
        "     - **Address** (formatted address)\n",
        "     - **Latitude** (location latitude)\n",
        "     - **Longitude** (location longitude)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Build a Dictionary**:\n",
        "   - Create a dictionary to store this information, using the variable names as values and the following keys:\n",
        "     - `\"name\"`\n",
        "     - `\"address\"`\n",
        "     - `\"latitude\"`\n",
        "     - `\"longitude\"`\n",
        "\n",
        "   Your dictionary should look like this:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   location_data = {\n",
        "       \"name\": name,\n",
        "       \"address\": address,\n",
        "       \"latitude\": latitude,\n",
        "       \"longitude\": longitude\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Output the Result**:\n",
        "   - Print the dictionary to the console to see the organized data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Output\n",
        "\n",
        "If done correctly, your output should look similar to this:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "{\n",
        "    \"name\": \"Washington Monument\",\n",
        "    \"address\": \"2 15th St NW, Washington, DC 20024, USA\",\n",
        "    \"latitude\": 38.8895,\n",
        "    \"longitude\": -77.0353\n",
