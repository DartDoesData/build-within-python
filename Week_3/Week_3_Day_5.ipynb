        "\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "1. **`people`**: A list containing the names of the people we need to ask for lunch orders.\n",
        "2. **`orders`**: An empty list that we will fill with user input.\n",
        "3. **Loop**: We‚Äôll use a `for` loop to go through each person in the `people` list and ask for their order.\n",
        "4. **`.append()`**: This method adds the user's input (their order) to the `orders` list.\n",

        "```python\n",
        "# List of people\n",

        "3. **`for person in people`**:\n",
        "   - **`for`**: The loop keyword, used to iterate over the list.\n",
        "   - **`person`**: The current name in the loop.\n",
        "   - **`in people`**: This specifies the list we are looping through.\n",
        "4. **`input()`**: Prompts the user to enter a lunch order.\n",
        "5. **`.append(order)`**: Adds the entered order to the `orders` list.\n",
        "6. **`for i in range(len(people))`**:\n",
        "   - **`len(people)`**: Returns the number of names in the `people` list.\n",
        "   - **`range(len(people))`**: Creates a sequence of indexes from `0` to the length of the list minus one.\n",
