    "Python is a popular programming language used for data manuipulation, integrations, and machine learning. Popular use cases include:\n",
    "* Read and write to files\n",
    "* Connect to databases\n",
    "* API interactions\n",
    "* Server-side data processing \n",
    "* Machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Python?\n",
    "* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "* It has a simple syntax similar to the English language and allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Syntax\n",
    "* Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n",
